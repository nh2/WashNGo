Installation of WashNGo

> ./configure
> make all
> su
# make install
# exit

and you are done!

To compile the example code use

> make examples

To install the examples, move the executables to your web server's CGI
directory. There are some suitable targets in Examples/Makefile, but
they need to be customized to your setup.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This procedure installs the following executables:
* wash2hs, the WASH preprocessor
* washc, the WASH compiler (a shell script which calls GHC with the correct options)

and the Haskell package WashNGo which provides hierarchical modules at
the following locations:
* WASH.Utility		various stuff
* WASH.HTML		XHTML generation
* WASH.Mail		interfaces for sending and parsing mail
* WASH.CGI		the scripting library
* WASH.Dbconnect	simple database connection library (if configured)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Alternatively, you may interact directly with Cabal to build and
install the system (except the washc script). 

> ./Setup.lhs configure
> ./Setup.lhs build
> su
# ./Setup.lhs install
# exit

A draft user manual is available from the WASH web site
http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/WASH

To create the haddock documentation use

> make haddock

NOTE

In some setting, it will be complicated to get everything to work with
the database connection. The reason is that some versions of c2hs
(0.13.6 in particular) do not install properly as a package: the
hs-libraries component of the package description is missing with the
consequence that programs do not link properly. If you can fix they
you fly.

Installing newer versions (0.14.2 or 0.14.3) is not possible out of
the box because they require cabal with version >= 1.0.1. Alas, GHC
6.4.1 ships with 1.0. Installing cabal-1.1.4 does not help either
because... 

.../c2hs-0.14.3 > ./Setup.hs build
Preprocessing executables for c2hs-0.14.3...
Building c2hs-0.14.3...
Chasing modules from: c2hs/toplevel/Main.hs
Could not find module `CForeign':

Oh well.
